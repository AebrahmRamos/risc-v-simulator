# RISC-V Simulator - Frontend (Milestone 1)

Quick scaffold: Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind. Components for Milestone 1 live in `src/components`.

To run locally:

```bash
cd web
npm install
npm run dev
```

Notes:
- This is a UI-only scaffold with mock data. Backend endpoints will be wired later.
- Editor is a simple textarea for Milestone 1; Monaco can be added later.
